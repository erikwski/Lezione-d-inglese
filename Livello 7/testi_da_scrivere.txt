STORY TELLING ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU WANT
I'm going to describe a day that changed in a very good way my life, it was my first day in a new
class because in 2016 i have decided to change school.

i was riding to school very fast because i was very late because the past night, i forgot to set the alarm
 and obviously i woke up late and there was a lot of traffic because at the first day, the parents used to took their children to school,
 when i was arrived at school i was 15 minutes late.
That means, when i went to my new class, the only chair free was the chair in front of the teacher near a 
random guy i never seen and i realized i didn't know anynobody there.
In that day, me and that random guy have talked a lot about everything and we discovered we have a lot in common
so in the afternoon, after getting a lunch togheter. we decided to met in the evening but i can't remember what we do in that night.
This random guy's name is Andrei and he is my actual best friend since that day.
